# modern-design

- This is a mockup of a landing page for a companies website. It's built using a grid system, featuring generic text and images. HTML, jQuery and CSS used.

- The aim is to make this a mobile friendly site too (which is starting to take shape).

- The site can be found here: https://andybluey.github.io/modern-design/
